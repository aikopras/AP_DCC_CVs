// Author:    Aiko Pras
// History:   2022/07/19 AP Version 1.0
//
// Purpose:   Timer library
//
// This library is inspired and largely based on MoToTimer.h from the MoBaTools library:
// https://github.com/MicroBahner/MobaTools
// It was developed since the MoBaTools library did not compile on DxCore boards
//
// The differences between MoToTimer.h and this library are small:
// - The class name was changed from MoToTimer to DccTimer
// - The "runTime" variable has been made public, to allow initialising the "runTime" without
//   immediately starting the timer.
// - "start()" has been added, which is equivalent to "restart()".
// - The code has been simplified and has become shorter.
//   In particular the 2 flags that were used in the original MoToTimer.h (RUNNING, NOTEXPIRED)
//   have been replaced by a single flag (notExpired).
//
